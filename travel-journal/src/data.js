        description: `Odesa owes its character and rapid development during the 19th century 
        to the success of its port, the favourable policies of its governors, and its status 
        as a free port city from 1819 to 1859. Trade attracted many diverse people who formed 
        multi-ethnic and multicultural communities, making Odesa a cosmopolitan city. Its pace 
        of development, the wealth it generated and its multiculturalism all influenced its architectural 
        expression and the variety of styles that still remain in the urban landscape.`
